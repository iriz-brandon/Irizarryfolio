# Awesome Stryker

   Includes a clickable jar file. Just need java installed.
   
   This game was created as a homage to the old school hand-held game Solar Stryker.
   
   This was my first attempt at a large scale project incorporating MVC ideas.  
   
   Testing - click the jar and press play!
   
      Move with arrow keys and shoot with space-bar!
      
   Be aware the play button can be a bit defiant, but eventually it will give in. Also the game isn't balanced so play
   at your own risk! Power ups can also last indefinitely.
