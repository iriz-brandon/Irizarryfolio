# Irizarryfolio

   GitHub repo for Brandon Irizarry, containing code samples that show past work.

# C++ Folder

  This folder currently only contains the MeterpreterKiller project. It finds windows processes that 
  have been injected with meterpreter and then kills those processes.

# C Folder

   This folder is made up of some code samples in C from class assignments at UTSA.
  
# Java Folder
   
   This folder contains a Java project worked on while taking the Software Development concentration part of my 
   Computer Science degree at UTSA. It also includes a runnable jar file for easy testing. Must have java installed.
   
# JavaScript Folder
     
  This folder contains sample javascript code similar to work I have done as an intern for a start-up company
  that deals in application development mostly for iOS. Not being native to iOS, I was tasked more with back-end 
  operations dealing with the cloud databases and user actions. These are examples of operations I implemented. Due 
  to the sensitive nature of the back-end for any app, I was asked to keep samples here to a minimum as to not reveal
  anything about their databases.
