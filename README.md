# Irizarryfolio

   GitHub repo for Brandon Irizarry, containing code samples that show past work.

# C++ Folder

   This folder is made up of code samples in C from my Systems class during the Fall 2014 semester. 
   This class is brutal and passes about 50% or less of the students originally enrolled at the start. Many would call
   this the "gate-keeper class"(Taught by Dr. Maynard) for the UTSA Computer Science degree.

# HTML_CSS Folder

   This folder contains a code sample for a page I made in a web-app tool. I had to learn enough about the about the 
   existing HTML/CSS, the Quill api, knockout.js, and incorporate mandrill to make it happen.
 
  
# Java Folder
   
   This folder contains a Java project worked on while taking the Software Development concentration part of my 
   Computer Science degree. It also includes a runnable jar file for easy testing. 
   
   
# JavaScript Folder
     
  This folder contains sample javascript code similar to work I have done as an intern for a start-up company
  that deals in application development mostly for iOS. Not being native to iOS, I was tasked more with back-end 
  operations dealing with the cloud databases and user actions. These are examples of operations I implemented. Due 
  to the sensitive nature of the back-end for any app, I was asked to keep samples here to a minimum as to not reveal
  anything that could be a window into one of their databases.
