#quillEmailPage

   This was an attempt at adding functionality to an already existing web application tool
   to make emailing bulk users easier. 
   
   The purpose of this was to create a page within the webapp that could be used to email 
   all users(or a single user), thus making it easy for the non-developer members of the team
   to communicate events and info to users of the app that the webapp is associated with.
   
   I know this appears basic, but this was coded as a preliminary field test as something
   that could be potentially used. Ultimately this idea was not used. 
   
   ** In the associated knockout.js code, this excerpt was pulled from a much larger knockout.js file
      that calls these functions all within a master function thus the "self." initialization.
      Also assume the necessary ko.observables are hooked up.
